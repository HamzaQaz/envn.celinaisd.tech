- [x] Updated `README.md` with new tech stack information

## üî® Known Issues & Remaining Work

### 1. Nginx Configuration (See Issue Template)
**Status:** Documentation provided, needs implementation

The React app builds to `client/dist/` and requires proper nginx configuration to:
- Serve static React build files
- Proxy API requests to Express backend (port 3000)
- Handle WebSocket connections for Socket.io
- Support React Router with fallback to index.html

**Action Required:**
- Follow `nginx.conf.example` for configuration
- Test in production environment
- Verify WebSocket connections work through nginx

### 2. shadcn/ui Component Library (See Issue Template)
**Status:** Partial implementation, additional components needed

**Currently Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Button component
- ‚úÖ Card component family
- ‚úÖ Input component

**Missing Components (may be needed):**
- [ ] Dialog - For modals in Admin panel
- [ ] AlertDialog - For delete confirmations
- [ ] Select - For dropdown filters
- [ ] Label - For form labels
- [ ] Badge - For status indicators
- [ ] Table - For data tables in History view
- [ ] Toast/Sonner - For notifications
- [ ] Dropdown Menu - For navigation menus

**shadcn Configuration:**
- ‚úÖ `components.json` configured
- ‚úÖ Tailwind theme extended with shadcn colors
- ‚úÖ CSS variables set up
- ‚úÖ `cn()` utility function available
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Can add more components as needed using: `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`

### 3. Code Quality Issues
**Status:** Non-critical linting warnings

Several linting warnings exist but don't affect functionality:
- React Hook dependency warnings (Dashboard, History)
- `any` type usage in some places (should be fixed gradually)
- Unused error variables in catch blocks
- Fast refresh warnings for exported constants

**Action Required:**
- Address linting errors gradually
- Add proper TypeScript types where `any` is used
- Fix React Hook dependencies

## üöÄ Production Deployment Checklist

When deploying to production, follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup**
   - [ ] Install Node.js 18+ on server
   - [ ] Install and configure MySQL database
   - [ ] Install nginx
   - [ ] Install PM2 for process management
   - [ ] Configure firewall (ports 80, 443, 22)

2. **Application Setup**
   - [ ] Clone repository to `/var/www/envn.celinaisd.tech`
   - [ ] Create `.env` file with production values
   - [ ] Create `client/.env` file with production API URL
   - [ ] Run `npm install` in root and client directories
   - [ ] Build: `npm run build`

3. **Nginx Configuration**
   - [ ] Copy `nginx.conf.example` to nginx sites-available
   - [ ] Update paths and domains
   - [ ] Enable site in sites-enabled
   - [ ] Test configuration: `nginx -t`
   - [ ] Reload nginx

4. **SSL/HTTPS**

- Future: Add Playwright/Cypress for E2E tests

## üìù Notes

### Technology Choices Explanation

**Why React?**
- Modern, component-based architecture
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Good performance with Virtual DOM

**Why Vite?**
- Extremely fast development server
- Optimized production builds
- Better DX than Create React App
- Native ES modules support

**Why Tailwind CSS?**
- Utility-first approach reduces CSS bloat
- Consistent design system
- Excellent with component libraries
- Built-in responsive design

**Why shadcn/ui?**
- Not a dependency, just copy-paste components
- Built on Radix UI (accessible by default)
- Fully customizable
- Works perfectly with Tailwind

**Why TypeScript?**
- Type safety reduces runtime errors
- Better IDE support and autocomplete
- Self-documenting code
- Easier refactoring

### Next.js Consideration

The original issue mentioned Next.js, but the current implementation uses **Vite + React Router** instead. This was likely a practical decision because:

1. **Simpler deployment** - No need for Node.js server for SSR
2. **Static deployment** - Can deploy to any static host (not just Vercel/Node servers)
3. **Faster dev experience** - Vite is faster than Next.js dev server
4. **Adequate for use case** - This is a dashboard/monitoring app, not a public website that needs SEO

If SSR or SSG is needed in the future, migration to Next.js is possible but not currently necessary.

### Redux Consideration

The original issue mentioned Redux for state management, but the current implementation uses **React hooks and Context API** instead. This is actually better for this application because:

1. **Simpler** - Less boilerplate than Redux
2. **Adequate** - State management needs are not complex
3. **Modern** - Hooks are the current React best practice
4. **Performant** - Real-time updates via Socket.io, not Redux actions

Redux could be added later if state management becomes more complex, but it's not needed now.
